SITUATION:
I was interning at Future-ready Talent, in collaboration with Microsoft, GitHub, and Aicte, aiming to learn and explore various technologies in the field of web development, including HTML, CSS, JS, and Azure.

TASK:
I was assigned the task of creating a prototype E-commerce website integrated with a FAQ bot. The main objective was to use HTML, CSS, JS, Bootstrap, and Azure technologies to develop a functional prototype. The website aimed to showcase a catalog of products for potential customers to explore and purchase. Additionally, the FAQ bot was incorporated to promptly address customer queries.

ACTION:

Learning Azure and Self-Study:

I began by completing self-learning modules on Microsoft Azure, understanding its features, and how it could be integrated into the project.
Research and Planning:

Conducted research on industry trends and best practices to incorporate into the project, ensuring the website would meet modern e-commerce standards.
Prototyping and Development:

Utilized HTML, CSS, JS, and Bootstrap to design and develop the prototype E-commerce website, ensuring a user-friendly interface and smooth navigation.
Integration of FAQ Bot:

Implemented a FAQ bot using Azure technologies to provide quick and automated responses to customer queries, enhancing user experience and support.
Testing and Debugging:

Conducted rigorous testing to ensure the website and FAQ bot functioned seamlessly across different devices and browsers, addressing and resolving any bugs or issues.
Collaboration via GitHub:

Leveraged GitHub for version control and collaborative development, facilitating smooth integration of code and effective teamwork.
RESULT:
The result of this project was a successful prototype of an E-commerce website featuring a catalog of products and an integrated FAQ bot. Users could browse through products and receive instant responses to their queries through the FAQ bot, streamlining the shopping experience. The experience gained during this internship greatly enhanced my understanding of web development and Azure technologies, providing a solid foundation for my future endeavors in the field.
